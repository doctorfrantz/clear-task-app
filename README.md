## IronHack Final Project

For this project we have to make a Task Management App where the users can create, edit, mark as completed and delete tasks on a To-Do List.

## Week 1

### December 6

Trying to understand what's going on. Some parts of the code are missing on purpose and we have to figure out what to do. Although it might seem easier than doing everything from scratch (which probably is), I am not getting something.

### December 7

I am having a bad time with Emmits, and I havent been able to put hours on the project because I had to work on other things.

### December 8

Emmit is working, but I am worried that I'll not have enough time to make everything. I am trying to make the user profile. I've created another table on supabase with the preset "profile" but I can't connect it to my App.

### December 9

After all the morning trying to make the profile, I've decided to venture into the wilderness and look for examples of vue 3 projects with vite and pinia, and created some sort of Frankenstein. I have not enough time to try to do it by myself so I'm going to take parts and make it work.

## Week 2

### December 12

Working on the design on Figma. After 4 tries I've managed to find what I think are the right colors. I've also created the icons and images like the checkboxes of the cards.

### December 13

Finished the Design and started to implement CSS. Huge mess, having everything centralized made me realise how badly I named the classes.

### December 14

CSS it's been more challenging than expected, specially with the cards, but everything is finished now. Started to work on the Dark/Light Switch.

### December 15

Working on finishing some problems with the CSS and implementing the Dark/Light Toggle Switch. I almost destroyed everything while trying to implement a Pomodoro Timer. I don't know exactly what I've done but I messed up everything, and I've spent more than 2 hours fixing it. I don't want to risk losing everything so I will just let it as it is by now.
